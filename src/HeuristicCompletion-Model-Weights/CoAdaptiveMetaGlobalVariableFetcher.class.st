`CoAdaptiveMetaGlobalVariableFetcher` is a smart, self-adjusting global variable fetcher that dynamically re-weights its underlying heuristics based on their past success. It’s designed to improve code completion suggestions over time by **learning from usage patterns**.

### Core Responsibilities

- **Combines Multiple Heuristic Fetchers**: It wraps several other fetchers, each responsible for suggesting global variables from different scopes.
- **Applies Adaptive Weights**: Unlike static weighting systems, this fetcher updates the weight (influence) of each sub-fetcher based on how often their suggestions are selected successfully.
- **Learns Over Time**: Every time a fetcher produces a successful suggestion, it’s recorded via `registerSuccessfulFetch:`. Periodically, weights are updated via `updateWeightsBasedOnSuccess` to prioritize better-performing fetchers.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Starts with a predefined weighted list of fetchers (e.g., repository-scoped, dependency-scoped, and transitive).
   - Initializes a success count dictionary to track how often each fetcher contributes a successful suggestion.

2. **Fetching Suggestions**:
   - When `entriesDo:` is called, each fetcher contributes suggestions.
   - Duplicate suggestions are combined, with their weights summed.
   - The resulting suggestions are sorted by total weight and passed to the provided block.

3. **Tracking Successes**:
   - If a suggestion is selected from a specific fetcher, `registerSuccessfulFetch:` is called with that fetcher.
   - This increases its success count.

4. **Rebalancing Weights**:
   - Calling `updateWeightsBasedOnSuccess` recalculates each fetcher’s weight based on the proportion of total successes it has accumulated.
   - Fetchers with higher success rates will contribute more strongly to future suggestions.

### Why Use This?

This fetcher is ideal when:
- You want **contextual, behavior-driven completion**, tailored to how developers actually use the system.
- The relevance of different fetchers may **shift over time** depending on project structure or team workflows.
- You want a **feedback loop** that improves the user experience without manual tuning.
